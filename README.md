Continuous time model for optimal capital structure with frictions (taxes, bankrupcty costs). Closed-form solutions for the value of equity, debt and total firm value. Firm assets generate cash flows according to a Geometric Brownian Motion, tax/coupon/bankruptcy costs are constant. Default leads to bankruptcy: debt can be liquidated or renegotiated.
